To build simple stop watch utility for Java using the System.nanoTime()

Most of the other implementations available were using the System.currentTimeMills() which is vastly inaccurate and insufficient.

Usage:

StopWatch watch = new StopWatch("fetching records").start();
watch.stop().prettyPrint(System.out, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

---OR---

StopWatch watch = new StopWatch("fetching records").start();
try{
	//do something
}
finally{
	watch.stop().prettyPrint(System.out, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
}

Look for other public methods in StopWatch class
